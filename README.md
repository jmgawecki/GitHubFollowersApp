# GHFollowers-Final
GitHub Followers App is the project I worked on while getting to know Swift language for the first time in my life. App was designed by Sean Allen and recreated few times by myself throughout the course. I've decided to slightly modified the app by adding supplementary views to compositional layout.

Technology used:
- UIKit
- Network Calls
- User Defaults as Persitence Manager 
- GitHub APIs
- Collection View
- Diffable Data Source
- Compositional Layout
- Collection View's supplementary view
- UI adjustment to screen sizes (including iPhone SE 1st gen. and iPhone 8 Zoomed)
- Night/Light mode UI adjustment

Some small issues exist that has not been resolved yet
